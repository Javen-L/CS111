Smoke-test cases in check:
	   case 0:
                Call lab0 with no option and pass a test message to stdin.
                Check 1) if the process exits with status 0, and
                      2) if the contents of stdout match those of stdin.
	   case 00:
	   	Call lab0 with valid --input and --output options.
		Check 1) if the process exits with status 0, and
                      2) if the contents of input match those of output.
	   case 1:
	   	Call lab0 with an unrecognized argument.
		Check if the process exits with status 1.
	   case 2:
	   	Call lab0 with an --input filename that does not exists.
		Check if the process exits with status 2.
	   case 3:
	   	Call lab0 with an --output filename that cannot be open.
                Check if the process exits with status 3.
	   case 4:
	   	Call lab0 with --segfault and --catch options.
